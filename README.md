## Dataset

This project utilises a custom-generated synthetic driving dataset, specifically designed for training machine learning models for autonomous vehicle lane-keeping.

The dataset comprises **34,379 grayscale images** captured from a simulated front-facing camera, covering driving scenarios on both **straight road segments** and a **curved (left-turn) arc**. Each image is paired with a corresponding steering angle label.

**Access the complete dataset on Kaggle:**
